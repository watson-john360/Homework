        <div class="w3-container"><p>One of the major <b>advantages</b> of Trunk Based Development is that branches are kept short, which encourages a steadier flow of smaller commits to the code base (one of the core principles of Continuous Integration). This in turn helps avoid major merge conflicts and shrinks the scope of build-breaking commits. If the <a href="phab_overview.html">workflow</a> is followed properly, any conflicts or breaks should be immediately and easily identifiable.</p>
            
        <p>Trunk Based Development is not perfect for every project; one of the major <b>drawbacks</b> is that developers are committing directly to the trunk. This requires a large amount of trust in the developers knowledge and skills, and the potential for a build-breaking commit is larger. However, these potential risks can be largely mitigated by adapting the development workflow and employing Test-Driven Development practices (unit testing, acceptance testing, post-commit auditing, etc).</p>
